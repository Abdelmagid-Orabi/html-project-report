<h1>Categories of Artificial Intelligence Page</h1>
 Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak and strong.
<h2>Narrow AI</h2>
( Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI")
Include a system designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you [1,2].
<h3>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):</h3>
( AGI, sometimes referred to as "Strong AI")
It is the kind of artificial intelligence we see in the movies, like the robots from West world or Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. AGI is a machine with general intelligence and, much like a human being, These tend to be more complex and complicated systems , it can apply that intelligence to solve any problem. These kinds of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or in hospital operating rooms[1, 2].
